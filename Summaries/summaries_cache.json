You can also define command execution ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/terminal#command-execution-modes ) rules. * With rules ( https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules#rules ) and /commands ( https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands ), you can configure system-level instructions and reusable workflows. * With cloud agents ( https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent ), you can spawn asynchronous agents that edit and run code in a remote environment. - Cursor Team Unsubscribe ( https://track.customer.io/unsubscribe/dgT_pwsBAPSntBzzp7QcAZreYtiKChCS8UINgrjOHg== )"
