This email provides a detailed summary of the current progress, challenges, and next steps regarding our Digital Transformation Initiative. Given the scope of the project and the number of teams involved, I have included a thorough breakdown of each component below to ensure complete transparency and alignment moving forward. During the past quarter, we have successfully completed Phase 2 of the implementation roadmap, which focused primarily on infrastructure modernization and process automation. Our IT team migrated 85% of legacy applications to the cloud-based environment ahead of schedule, significantly improving system reliability and data accessibility. The operations division reported a 22% reduction in manual workflows, largely due to the automation of invoice processing and internal approval chains. In addition, the cybersecurity framework was reinforced with new endpoint protection and identity access management protocols, reducing vulnerability exposure by approximately 40%. However, several challenges were encountered that have temporarily slowed progress in certain areas. The integration of the analytics dashboard with third-party data sources has faced compatibility issues, primarily due to differing API structures and outdated documentation. The development team is currently collaborating with the vendors to resolve these inconsistencies. Additionally, the HR digital portal rollout was postponed to mid-December following feedback from the pilot test group, who suggested improvements in user navigation and mobile responsiveness. These refinements are now underway, and the revised deployment timeline remains within acceptable project parameters. Looking ahead, our next milestone involves finalizing Phase 3 — the employee engagement and performance analytics system. This module will unify data from multiple departments to provide leadership with real-time visibility into productivity metrics, training needs, and talent development trends. The design and prototype review are scheduled for the second week of November, followed by iterative testing and feedback collection through December. I strongly encourage department heads to nominate representatives to participate in these review sessions, as early input will ensure that the system meets diverse operational requirements. In terms of budget, the initiative remains within 3% of the approved allocation. Savings from the infrastructure migration have helped offset additional consulting expenses related to system integration. A detailed financial summary will be included in next week’s report. Furthermore, the procurement team has begun evaluating long-term vendor contracts to identify opportunities for cost optimization in 2026. Finally, I want to emphasize that the success of this transformation depends not only on technology but also on collaboration and adaptability across all departments. Your continued engagement, open feedback, and proactive participation are key to achieving our shared goals. Please review the attached document for the updated project timeline, key deliverables, and ownership matrix. Thank you for your ongoing support and commitment to making this initiative a success. Should you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly or to the project management office. Warm regards, Ahmed Raza Project Director – Digital Transformation TechNova Systems Pvt. Ltd."

I know, I know, I've been teasing ngrok's AI gateway for too long. Good news: You can actually use it today. ngrok.⁠ai is now in early access! You now have one gateway to route LLM requests to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or your own self-hosted models. Point your existing OpenAI compatible SDK at your gateway URL, then configure multi-provider/key failover, select models/providers based on usage or latency, and observe everything in one place. Multi-key rotation, CEL-based model selection, content modification via Traffic Policy—yup, it's a lot, but it's also just the start. We all couldn't be more thrilled to see what you create and build around your feedback. Get started now, see what's coming soon → (https://d2v8tf04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/5F+113/d2v8tf04/MWXqSRF2b-nV78fTz5ZV8k1W1TDTHt5H83KlN179mr03pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3lQW8x16JV5hml27VKLz3l6PRH6MW8vPjjn71yygtW3CSw4H1zSQMNW6PSBqx6w2Z0mW5kYt5Z5Vzh1JW1dtQL87rN-HsW2fKH635Ns_L8N97yhzxMx8-fW3xhnh68j1dCSVgQbmj6s9mVFN5c7NCkVtlWzW2DYxNL4zXPN7VdXSv63rXvrTW2Fm5Bl8syPn9W4DjZtz2L3dRQW5YtTwM4chLstW5rfBMG31VJ14W5T-Hwz85LZswW4D9SzB2NN4f3W5V6xGx2g1lGkW1SP7-q6ZP3VWVWStms2ftCYFW5RfFw14GXQ3JW7Rk_9l6nc8q0W18MyRg4qfvS1N4hrzFFBgrZyW2_cf1V6G5Nn4f93Klfv04 ) Read the docs → (https://d2v8tf04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/5F+113/d2v8tf04/MWXqSRF2b-nV78fTz5ZV8k1W1TDTHt5H83KlN179mr03pyd0W8wLKSR6lZ3pgW3NwKPW3gGbXVW8w13TP89fzl4V1S5wD8y9kPxW427vV21Jl1ZTW6b8SVW7DsmvFW822r9x47PQk9N5RDMLCXD120W6BctJR1gtTlBW81wPnh4kjMLKVqLd8m1Sv8pqW7lV-Rg7dPgGbW3cd3Wq8pR9RMW3x5XW54Nll4nW84Wp_61vtdk7N2QNhKR1VKKpW5H49lr5s8g-fW2Pzc4V5chsr2W1QPNx872Zr-cN2-D21_pCH4QW7Bv01F3GgBXPN6BqhR_V2Z_CW5MJLHl8PcHcmN6spqnl8h4_WW7DHb_V1Y-r_4W4my0j62yVkRDW4w2D8L3qzvn3W5Ffrzq3KGdTfW8w1fPC4RHcgbdkf82R04 ) ... or watch a 4-minute video walkthrough (https://d2v8tf04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/5F+113/d2v8tf04/MWXqSRF2b-nV78fTz5ZV8k1W1TDTHt5H83KlN179mqq3pyd0W7lCdLW6lZ3pRW8-62ff6czGVCW3kCpdn7Ttx0CW4k6vZ-4XK7kZW66C_7T75hXLzW4xB-5p1Mrb9jW8b2-CT24Nv_sW6Jrk018LpHFFW3FggFB77H9cDW3XvRrw7-FR7RW16DGgv2R2B3VW67k6LX8B-hgtW4PRjxd7n0xvJW7PYHFg8Mn5cKW8vvBw_6zZZ-yW6HRpYB2PcFXHW51HJg58ZFsFRVy7Pjb2r8pkJW5WRp6N7JCJ9FW1zF6Yg5c7KQpN8C17dRL-D8kW3Czjp574YY1sW94dMqR8r-WmVW3nxH1951q-M6V5nH6Y1lzRjff5qTbjM04 ) with yours truly ↓ Frame 1(1) (https://d2v8tf04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/5F+113/d2v8tf04/MWXqSRF2b-nV78fTz5ZV8k1W1TDTHt5H83KlN179mqq3pyd0W7lCdLW6lZ3pRW8-62ff6czGVCW3kCpdn7Ttx0CW4k6vZ-4XK7kZW66C_7T75hXLzW4xB-5p1Mrb9jW8b2-CT24Nv_sW6Jrk018LpHFFW3FggFB77H9cDW3XvRrw7-FR7RW16DGgv2R2B3VW67k6LX8B-hgtW4PRjxd7n0xvJW7PYHFg8Mn5cKW8vvBw_6zZZ-yW6HRpYB2PcFXHW51HJg58ZFsFRVy7Pjb2r8pkJW5WRp6N7JCJ9FW1zF6Yg5c7KQpN8C17dRL-D8kW3Czjp574YY1sW94dMqR8r-WmVW3nxH1951q-M6V5nH6Y1lzRjff5qTbjM04 ) A whoops we need to cop to: If you never got a You’ve got the golden ticket email from us, it's because our signup form was broken for a while.
